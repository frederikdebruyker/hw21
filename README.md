# hw21 Exoplanet Exploration
2 alternatives explored:
- randomforest: the requirement 'Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features' indicated a randomforest to me, and I had not seen the starter code, and as such I built this model: randomforest.ipynb
- startercode: svm.ipynb
## Model Performance
Scores (test):
- Randomforest: 0.90
